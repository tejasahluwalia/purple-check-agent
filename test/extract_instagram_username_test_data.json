				"selftext": "The person who owns Amrrutam was really mean and rushed, and they charged way too much for stuff that wasn't very good. Even if the stuff was okay, the owner was so rude that it ruined everything. \n\nI bought something from there and after wearing it just twice, small diamonds fell off. It was still under warranty, but when I asked the owner, Richa Gupta, about it, she was really mean. She said they wouldn't replace the diamonds because they only cover fixing the color and polish. But they never said that on their website. She talked over me and acted like she didn't care. It's better to stay away from that online store.\n\nThe owner's hurtful words caused me a lot of pain, and no product is worth that kind of trauma. She repeatedly accused and abused me of writing fake reviews, which made things even worse. It took me nearly a year to share my experience, but seeing others fall victim to similar scams on Instagram and reading them here pushed me to speak up on my sister\u2019s insistence. \n\nDealing with the owner herself was a nightmare, the harassment I faced from her made it seem better to just accept a big loss rather than interact with her. The products were terrible quality, and the service was the worst I've ever experienced. I can't stop thinking about how she spoke to me. I know this can come across as so harsh and rude but I really have never been spoken to like this. She was very sweet the first time while buying and then the way she talked later made me feel so shitty about myself. \n\nIt's hard to understand why it took me so long to share this, but if you can afford it, I suggest shopping in a physical store or ordering from a more reputable place. Don't get fooled by this. They don't provide authenticity cards to prove their products are actually 92.5% silver, and they charge way too much for such low-quality items.\n\nHelp me post this in the bigger community, \nr/Instacelebgossip as well\nI have very low karma and the post has not yet been approved by mods there.\n",

				"selftext": "I want to share my experience with ATCASA, as it has been incredibly frustrating. On December 18, 2024, I ordered three cases. After that, there was no communication for several days, so I contacted them. They told me that one of the cases was defective, which is why they hadn\u2019t shipped the other two. What frustrated me the most was that they never informed me about the delay, and I had to reach out to them to find out.\n\nSince the third case was defective, they asked me to choose a replacement, but I didn\u2019t want one. I asked them to ship the two available cases right away and refund me for the third case. They told me their policy didn\u2019t allow direct refunds and instead offered me store credit valid for one year. I insisted on a refund, but they kept refusing, citing company policy. Eventually, they said the third case would be marked as an urgent pre-order and would arrive by the second week of January, even though they initially said it would take 5-7 weeks.\n\nI also asked about shipping the other two cases, and they assured me they would ship those first. After receiving advice from a fellow Reddit user who had a similar experience, I kept calling and texting them through Instagram and WhatsApp for an update. Despite my repeated attempts, they ignored my messages and calls. After calling them nearly 50 times in one day, I finally received the tracking ID.\n\nOn January 7, 2025, I received the two cases, and today, I finally received the third case. However, the quality of the third case is very poor compared to the price I paid, and it's disappointing considering the long wait.\n\nIn conclusion, please do not buy from ATCASA. Their customer service has been disappointing, and the entire process has been full of delays, broken promises, and subpar product quality.\n\n\nTL;DR: I ordered three cases from ATCASA on December 18, 2024. They delayed shipping, didn\u2019t inform me about the issues, and offered store credit instead of a refund. After countless calls, I received two cases on January 7, 2025, and the third case today. However, the quality of the third case is poor compared to the price I paid. Avoid ATCASA at all costs. ",
